            Welcome to Probability Turtle. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This site was simply built with nostalgia in mind. 
            The goal was to build a functional website imitating the browser, time-waster type games of the 2000's.
            <br>
            <br> 
            I took specific inspiration from a tik-tok auto which posed the question: 
            <br>
            <br>
            "If you had the opportunity to press a button for $25,000, but there was a 1% chance you'd turn into a turtle, how many times would you press it?"
